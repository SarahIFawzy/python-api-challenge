# **World City Weather Analysis**
## Using APIs to analyzie and plot cities to determine best vacation fit

A list of ~600 randomly generated latitudes and longitues was created, then the closes cities to those lats/longs was found.  Using a weather API, the weather, humidity, and wind speed were found for those cities.  The list was then narrowed down for ideal conditions and another API was used to find the closest hotel to the narrowed-down city.
